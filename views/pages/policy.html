  <div id="natural_materials" class="policy_area">
      <h4 class="blue_solid"><i class="fa fa-pagelines"></i> natural materials policy:</h4>
      <p>Due to the nature of natural materials such as wood, fabric, paper, etc., the grains, fibers, patterns, textures, and colors may have slight variations in appearance and size.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="hand_made" class="policy_area">
      <h4 class="blue_solid"><i class="fa fa-pencil-square-o"></i> handmade policy:</h4>
      <p>Due to the handmade nature of some of our products and available supplies, products may have slight differences than the advertised product picture. We like to make our products custom, unique, and designed specifically for you.</p>
      <p>In regards to the baby quilts and blankets, each item is made by hand and unique. We like to make these quilts and blankets one-of-a-kind and so we make only one of each design that we come up with instead of mass producing. No one else will have a blanket like that one; it will be special just for you or that person that you are gifting it to.</p>

  <div id="invitation_process" class="policy_area">
      <h4 class="blue_solid"><i class="fa fa-star"></i> Invitation and announcement process:</h4>
      <p>When purchasing invitations and/or announcements from us, you will first add the sample that you like to your cart. Then, you will be taken to your shopping cart where you can either click the button to keep shopping or you can complete your order. When you are ready to complete your order, you will fill out the order form in the shopping cart and, at that point, you might notice that you are not paying the full cost of the invitations and/or announcements yet but just paying for our time and supplies to get your custom invitations and/or announcements started and samples made. After the order is received and you have paid your starting fee, you will be sent an email that will tell you what we need from you (for example: pictures, names, dates, addresses) in order to create your invitations and/or announcements. Then, after we receive your information, we will begin to make your custom sample. It will take us anywhere from a few hours to a few days depending on how busy we are and how many orders we have to fill. After your sample has been created, we will send an email to the email address that you provided when placing the order that will contain a link for you to log in to preview and approve the sample. Please, at this point, double check the text and colors and make sure that it all looks correct. We would hate to send you invitations and/or announcements that have names spelled incorrectly or the wrong dates or addresses. If everything looks correct, then you will approve the sample and pay the rest of the invitation and/or announcement cost. If something looks off to you or if the information is incorrect, check the “No, let’s make some changes” box and you can let us know what changes need to be made. Once the sample is approved and payment is received, we will send your invitations and/or announcements to the printer. Then, we will inspect the product when it comes back from the printer to assure quality before the product is shipped to you. After this, we will ship the product to you and send you a message that the product is on its way to you. And finally, you will receive your product! After receiving your product, if you would like, please leave us a comment, review, or email so we can know how we did. We would love to hear from you!</p>
      <p>If you have any other questions about this process that we use for invitations and/or announcements, please contact us at contactus@tiedwithstrings.com and we will get back to you with answers as soon as we can.</p>

      <p>We have not enabled Google AdSense on our site but we may do so in the future.
      <h5>California Online Privacy Protection Act</h5>
      <p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy. - See more at: <a href="http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf" target="_blank">http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf</a></p>
      <p>According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:
      Users can visit our site anonymously.
      Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page or as a minimum on the first significant page after entering our website.
      Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy' and can be easily be found on the page specified above.</p>
      <p>Users will be notified of any privacy policy changes on our Privacy Policy Page</p>
      <p>Users are able to change their personal information by emailing us.</p>
      <h5>How does our site handle do not track signals?</h5>
      <p>We honor do not track signals and do not track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place.
      <h5>Does our site allow third-party behavioral tracking?</h5>
      <p>It's also important to note that we do not allow third-party behavioral tracking.</p>
      <h5>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h5>
      <p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under 13, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, the nation's consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.
      <p>We do not specifically market to children under 13.</p>
      <h5>Fair Information Practices</h5>
      <p>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.
      <p>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will notify the users via email within 7 business days.</p>
      <p>We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle, which requires that individuals have a right to pursue legally enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.</p>
